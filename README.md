# Check LUFS

## Background

I have ripped or edited some tracks from records, but some of them have not enough sound volume.
So, I have to select which file should be fixed.
Then, I made a shell command to check and list up LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale) level of them.

## Description

This project aims to provide a tool for checking LUFS levels in audio files.
It can be used to ensure compliance with loudness standards and regulations.

## Installation

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/check-lufs.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `bash setup.sh`
3. Run the tool: `bash check_LUFS.sh`

## Usage

To check the LUFS levels of an audio file, run the following command:

```shell
bash check_LUFS.sh path/to/audio/folder
```

Replace `path/to/audio/folder` with the actual path to your audio file folder.
